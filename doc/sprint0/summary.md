### Key Usage Scenarios (Example of real situations)

### Scenario 1
A university student, Amaya, struggles with procrastination. 
She logs her mood using the mood slider in the app every morning, and she selects “unmotivated.” The app generates a warm, supportive message, “Let’s just take one small step together,” or “You deserve a small kind start.” Using the habit tracking dashboard, she can organize her tasks and view her progress.

### Scenario 2: Wellness enthusiast 
Leo uses the app to track habits like meditation and hydration through the analytics dashboard to view all his journaling and mood patterns. It helps him address his mood, reflect on it, journal it and conquer it,
creating a positive cycle to learn about his mood.

### Scenario 3: Remote worker
Emily is a hybrid employee and often juggles her schedule, constantly changing it every few days. She uses the edit and delete tasks/habits tool to format it throughout the week, adjusting and reprioritizing tasks based on the days she stays home and goes to work. The flexibility and user-friendly interface allow her to stay organized and maintain productivity while managing her workload.

### Scenario 4: Content creator
Ryan is a digital content creator. He uses the daily completion tracking feature to stay on track with his everyday progress towards his milestone. This is similar to a dopamine hit from mindless scrolling, coming from a productive task completion,  
and helps him feel accomplished. He can plan meaningful breaks without procrastinating or working straight for hours. This creates a manageable workflow and protects his mental and overall well-being.
