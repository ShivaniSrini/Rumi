# Process

## Team Organization 
Our team consists of five members. During Sprint 0, our main focus was on organizing responsibilities and setting up our workflow before starting any code development. We created a Google Sheet to enter all our availabilities and another Google Sheet to delegate tasks. Each row listed the document or setup item (e.g., team.md, process.md, summary.md, competition.md, personas.pdf, PB.md, done.md, and README.md) along with the member responsible 
We divided roles based on strengths and interests:

Project Coordinator: scheduled meetings, ensured deadlines were met, and submitted final files.
Documentation Leads (2): drafted shared Markdown documents like process.md and summary.md.
Design Lead: worked on UI/UX wireframes and personas.
Setup Lead: created the GitHub Classroom repository, organized the Trello board, and managed shared Google Drive folders.

This organization ensured everyone contributed equally, and all setup tasks were completed efficiently before coding began.

## Decision Making
Sprint 0 focused on planning, so most decisions involved structuring our documents, tools, and workflow. We took a collaborative approach where each member shared their thoughts in Discord discussions and Google Docs comments. For larger decisions (such as tool choice, Trello layout, or defining our MVP), we talked through the options and reached a group consensus after everyone had a chance to speak.
Smaller decisions (like formatting or assigning a document section) were made quickly in our Discord server to keep things efficient and on schedule.

## Prioritizing User Stories
During Sprint 0, we created our initial user stories and documented them in PB.md. We prioritized stories based on three main factors:

User importance: How much the story impacts the main experience (habit tracking and reminders).

Feasibility: What could realistically be developed first in Sprint 1?

Dependencies: Which stories needed to be completed before others could start?

As a team, we discussed the list together and came to a shared agreement on which stories belonged in our minimum viable product (MVP). Those top stories were recorded first on Trello to guide the start of development.

## Meetings
We held weekly meetings throughout Sprint 0 to review our documents and assign tasks. Additional meetings were scheduled when we needed to finalize major deliverables, such as the personas or summary brief. We also used many forms of communication, such as iMessages and Discord, to stay on track regarding project updates, notes and documentations. This structure helped us coordinate asynchronously and kept everyone on the right track between meetings.

## Lessons for the Next Phase

From Sprint 0, we learned how valuable clear communication, delegation, and planning are before development begins. Having an organized system in Google Sheets and Discord helped prevent overlap and confusion.

**For Sprint 1, we plan to:**

- **All team members** should actively track and update incomplete and unassigned tasks in the future sprints.
- Set mid-week check-ins for smaller updates.
- Define clearer acceptance criteria in each user story to make implementation smoother.
- Begin integrating tools like Git branches and pull requests to support version control once development starts.
- Task delegation at the very start of the release of the sprint.
- Encourage and support other team members to complete their tasks on time.
