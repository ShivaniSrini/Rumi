## Why the Rumi (Reflect, Understand, Maintain & Improve) product differs

Who:
Rumi (Reflect, Understand, Maintain & Improve) works best for users who feel anxious or overwhelmed by traditional productivity tools such as students, remote workers, and self-care focused users who want structure without stress.

Scenarios:
It excels in situations where users need gentle accountability, such as managing schoolwork, maintaining focus while working from home, or building healthy daily routines.

Why competitors didn’t focus here:
Most existing apps (e.g., Habitica, Finch, TickTick) target users seeking performance, streaks, or competition. Designing for gentle consistency requires a different mindset, prioritizing emotional design, calm UX, and self-compassion over measurable performance.

What it would take for them to do so:
Competitors would need to redesign their core reward systems, add mood-based analytics, reflective journaling, and reduce pressure-driven mechanics. This shift would change their identity from “productivity tools” to empathy-centred wellness platforms.

## Target Users

Students: Struggle with procrastination and burnout. Our habit tracker helps them stay consistent through gentle reminders, mood tracking, and small positive rewards.

Working Professionals & Remote Workers: Seek balance between productivity and mental well-being. The tracker offers reflection tools and analytics to maintain structure without pressure.

Self-Care & Wellness Users: Prefer calm, mindful tools over strict productivity apps. The tracker provides journaling, affirmations, and a relaxing interface.

Accountability Partners: Friends or groups who want shared motivation. The Buddy List allows gentle check-ins and encouragement without competition.

## Specific Scenarios

Overwhelmed Student: Logs a stressful mood, completes a small task, and receives an encouraging message like “Small steps count.”

Remote Worker: Uses reflections to spot burnout patterns; gentle reminders help rebuild a healthy routine.

Wellness User: Tracks mood and habits, viewing progress through calm visuals and charts.

Supportive Friends: Motivate each other through short, positive notifications that celebrate progress together.
